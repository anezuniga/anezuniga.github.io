About me
======
I am Ane Zuñiga, a first-year graduate student at [MIT EECS](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/). I am advised by [Mina Konaković Luković](https://people.csail.mit.edu/mina/) at the [Algorithmic Design Group](https://adg.csail.mit.edu/).

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor’s Degrees in Electrical and Mechatronic Engineering from the [University of the Basque Country](https://www.ehu.eus/es/home) (Spain) and the [University of Applied Sciences Mittweida](https://www.hs-mittweida.de/en/) (Germany).
